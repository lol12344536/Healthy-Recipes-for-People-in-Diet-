									<h3> Healthy Eating Plate </h3>
                                    <p>The Healthy Eating Plate encourages people to use healthy oils and does not specify a maximum percentage of calories that should come from healthy fat sources each day. In this approach, the Healthy Eating Plate promotes the polar opposite of the USDA's decades-long low-fat messaging.</p>
                                    <h3> Protein  </h3>
									<p> Fish, chicken, beans, and nuts are all healthful, adaptable protein choices that go well with veggies on a plate and may be combined into salads. Limit your intake of red meat and steer clear of processed meats like bacon and sausage.</p>
                                    <h3> Whole grains  </h3>
									<p>Whole and intact grains, such as whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and dishes produced with them, such as whole wheat pasta, have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than refined grains such as white bread and white rice.</p>
                                    <h3> Drink Water  </h3>
                                    <p>Sugary drinks should be avoided, milk and dairy products should be limited to one to two meals per day, and juice should be limited to one small glass per day.</p>
                                    <h3> Healthy plant oils </h3>
                                    Avoid partly hydrogenated oils, which contain dangerous trans fats, and instead go for healthy vegetable oils like olive, canola, soy, maize, sunflower, peanut, and others. Keep in mind that "low-fat" does not equal "healthy."
